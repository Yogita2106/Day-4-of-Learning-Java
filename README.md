# Day-4-of-Learning-Java
In the day 4 I have learn about the OOPâ€™S CONCEPT and made the program of some problems based on { Creating a class with a constructor, Demonstrating method overloading by a class that accept different arguments ,Demonstrating abstraction ,Creating a static method and override it ,Demonstrating data hiding }.

The problems are as following:-

Q6. Create a class Person with a constructor that initializes name and age. Create a subclass Student that adds a field rollNumber. Use super to initialize inherited fields.

Q7. Demonstrate method overloading by creating a class Calculator with multiple add() methods that accept different numbers and types of arguments (int, double, etc.).

Q8. Write a program to demonstrate abstraction by creating an abstract class Payment with an abstract method pay(double amount). Implement it in CreditCardPayment and 
    UPIPayment classes.
    
Q9. Create two classes Parent and Child. In Parent, create a static method and try to override it in Child. Observe and explain the behavior.

Q10. Create a class DataHider with private data members. Use getter and setter methods to access and update the values of these members. Demonstrate data hiding(encapsulation).
